One of the most common questions I get as a data science consultant involves extracting content from =.pdf= files. In the best-case scenario the content can be extracted to consistently formatted text files and parsed from there into a usable form. In the worst case the file will need to be run through an optical character recognition (OCR) program to extract the text.

For years =pdftotext= from the [[https://poppler.freedesktop.org/][poppler]] project was my go-to answer for the easy case.
